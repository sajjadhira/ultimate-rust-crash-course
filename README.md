**Lesson -1: Varriables**

I can declear a variable in RUST programming using `let` as example,

`let name = "Sajjad Hossain";`

This is immutable variable, I am unable to change it's value again. But, if I want to change it's value then I've to change it to,

`let mut name = "Sajjad Hossain";`

Now I can change it's value,

`name = "Hira";`
